1. ​​Accuracy Comparison (Noise Addition vs. Baseline)​​

The directory 'Accuracy_of_predictors' contains quantitative analyses of prediction accuracy, comparing our proposed method (with intentional noise addition) against the baseline approach (without noise addition). The results are presented for multiple test sequences, highlighting the impact of noise addition on model robustness and performance.

2. ​​Low-Resolution Training (Vimeo-90K Dataset)​​

Detailed experimental findings for our model trained on the ​​low-resolution Vimeo-90K dataset​​ are documented in the PDF file within the directory 'Train_on_Vimeo-90K'.
